   "In order to do this I will take up and discuss a few selected studies in order to provide a more thorough examination. However, I believe that the studies chosen a representative of a more general approach to the study of computer game play. As such, the discussion carries relevance beyond the particular studies chosen, in that it discusses particular approaches to research as well as the general models of communication informing a particular strand of research. Still, such an approach necessarily implies that differences and nuances are downplayed in order to come up with a more generic pattern. Anyhow, I believe that such an approach is both legitimate and appropriate in regard to the question that I am trying to answer in and through this article."

   "1) One might add that such situations of interpersonal uncertainty may serve to inspire communication, something many players enjoy (Smith, 2002), as players look for cues of trustworthiness (or the opposite) in each other.",
   "2) The example with the time delays in banks highlights an important feature of strategic impotence, namely communication. For a time delay system to work preventively, potential bank robbers must be made aware that it has been installed. Similarly, Bob will not benefit from his tearing off his steering wheel if Alice does not see it. Examples of such behaviour in drama and in real life are legion. One should not, the saying goes, burn one's bridges but that is exactly what strategically limiting one's options is all about. For a thorough treatment of the phenomenon as it applies to social behaviour see (Frank, 1988).",
   "3) Although legal rights of avatars are attracting attention few systematic academic accounts of grief play exist. Popular accounts however are available in abundance. On 30 September 2003 for instance, Blizzard banned more than 400,000 game accounts from their Battle.net (Battle.net). The day before BBC News Online reported on the rise of in-game crime in MMORPGs (Ward, 2003).",
   "4) It should be noted that Axelrod's analysis to some degree depends on the setup of his experiment and that the analysis is not undisputed.",
   "5) Similarly, since users of Ebay.com rate each other after an interaction a blank (unrated) profile could mean either that one is facing an innocent new user or someone trying to run from a bad reputation by discarding an old profile.",
   "6) Though no systematic account has been published, such problems have been reported (e.g. (dustin_c1).",
   "7) While doing away with trust deficits this heavy-handed approach might of course have introduced other problems in the areas of interface design etc."

   "[iii] The promince of video game arcades was not lost on David Toop’s (1984) seminal study of hip hop. He writes: “Sharing the twilight zone of 42nd Street movie houses, drug dealers and seedy subterranean record stores are the video arcades. Video games have had a big influence on latter day hip hop - the arcades are bleeping, pulsing, 24-hour refuges for the obsessive vidkids with nowhere else to go” (p. 128).",

   "[3] More specifically, I consulted scans of game boxes on Mobygames.com, scans of arcade flyers at The Arcade Flyer Archive (http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/), and scans of various game magazines from Internet Archive (https://archive.org/details/gamemagazines) and Abandonware Magazine France  (http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/)",
   "[4] This part of the research was conducted in part by Hugo Montembault in the course of a funded research project on game genres and discourse communities. For more information: http://www.ludov.ca/en/observation/video-game-genres-and-discourse-communities.",
   "[5] The Video Game Theory Reader (2003), Digital Play (2003), Playing With Videogames  (2008), Tomb Raiders and Space Invaders (2005), Understanding Video Games: The Essential  Introduction (2008), The Video Game Explosion (2008), The Encyclopedia of Video Games (2012).",
   "[6] This part of the project could not have been completed without the dedication of Anthony Colpron, Mikaël Julien and Alexandre Poirier. Some issues of C&VG from 1994 were not available, and thus couldn’t be inspected for this research.",
   "[7] Another occurrence was found in a preview of Light Phaser games for the Sega Master system, but only for one specific shooting gallery that also uses Sega’s stereoscopic glasses: Missile Defense 3-D (CGW, no 48, June 1988, p. 42).",
   "[8] A similar description was found about Ubisoft’s Zombi (CGW no 78, January 1991, p.59). In CGW no 86 (September 1991), a preview for The Adventures of Willy Beamish (Dynamix) states that the creator “originally expected the interface to be handled from a first-person perspective, just like Rise of the Dragon and Heart of China” (p. 14).",
   "[9] The printed ads and packaging of Stellar 7 (Damon Slye, 1983) or Sherman M4 (Loriciel, 1989) put forth their outstanding 3-D graphics, made with wireframe and polygonal 3-D respectively.",
   "[10] See CGW no 61, p. 4; no 65, p. 25; no 68, p. 22; no 70, p.50; no 74, p.74; no 77, p. 22.",
   "[11] Sega’s Space Tactics  (1980) and Nintendo’s Radar Scope (1979) clearly copied the formula that inspired Tempest, but their respective flyers preferred to brag about “real-life 3-D” and “perspective effect”.",
   "[12] This occurrence of “first-person” was found on the back cover of the Australian release.",
   "[13] See http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_clones.",
   "[14] For instance, Hitman (IO Interactive, 2000) has been called a “3-D first person stealth game” (Konzack, 2008:208), and many “best first-person shooters” lists include third-person shooters (Meer, 2012) such as the Max Payne series (Remedy)."

   "[1] Harvey was author of “Essays on Astrology: Expository and Apologetic” published in 1906, but it’s unclear just how “famed” he was, as there is very little information about him that I have been able to uncover.",
   "[2] Talking vending machines have returned periodically since their appearance in the 1920s. For instance, in 1981 Coca-Cola released a speech synthesizer vending machine, and allowed the distributors to insert and play their own chosen background music using different computer chips.",
   "[3] Coin Machine journal ad: http://www.ipdb.org/showpic.pl?id=1872&picno=24401",
   "[4] The sound has become such a cliché that today’s pinball sounds are often swapped out to use the chime as a pinball signifier in TV and movies. Said Brian Schmidt, “As a pinball sound designer, it’s rather annoying because sometimes you’ll be watching a TV show and you’ll see a game you worked on, on the TV show and somebody will be playing it, and instead of the actual sounds that you did for that pinball machine, some sound editor has dubbed in ding ding ding ding even though it’s a game from 2009 or something like that.”",
   "[5] Some Internet databases, including the Internet Pinball Database (IPDB.org) mistakenly describe this game as having “synthesized” sound.",
   "[6] There is no space here to reiterate the long discussion of definitions of immersion or flow in games. For more on the subject, see for instance Cheng and Cairns 2005; Jennett et al 2008; Brown and Cairns 2004. Here I use immersion as the involvement and focus of the player on the game-world to such an extent that the external “real world” fades.  For more on the magic circle, see Huizinga 1955; Juul 2005."

   "[1] A disjunction of properties is true if the object has at least one of these properties (and nothing prevents it from having more than one).",
   "[2] We use the term “contingent” as it is standardly understood in philosophy. A property is contingent if it is not essential for a given object. In other words -- it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition. In modal terms -- the property belongs to the object in the actual world but it does not belong to it in every possible world.",
   "[3] The observation that “indie games” as a movement within game development are a contemporary phenomenon has been made before (for example, see Lipkin, 2013, p. 9).",
   "[4] More information: http://www.telefilm.ca/en/telefilm/investment-reports.",
   "[5] Especially through the modern forms of game advertising (i.e. materials on YouTube channels).",
   "[6] There are also smaller but equally important changes that make self-publishing easy. For example ESRB offers fast and free rating services for smaller digital games.",
   "[7] This example may surprise some readers but it is important to remember that big companies like Ubisoft distribute the tasks of development and publishing among its various divisions - studios which are even oftentimes based in different parts of the world.",
   "[8] Colossal Cave Adventure was financially (created in spare time with no investor), creatively (for personal use) and publishing-wise (uploaded to an academic mainframe network) independent. However, one might argue that the intended audience was not the developer himself but rather his daughters (see Jerz, 2007).",
   "[9] One thing that has to be pointed out is that we don't want to suggest that the term \"independent\" is timeless - just that it spans across a bigger time period - one that is big enough to cover current history of video games. If economic circumstances changed dramatically, it is possible that the disjunction would have to be abandoned or modified (for example, there is no point in talking about financial independence in a world without private property).",
   "[10] Elite Dangerous (Frontier Developments, 2014) is a good example of this.",
   "[11] For example, sequels to successful 8-bit style games aren’t typically 16-bit style games.",
   "[12] Even though it happens as in the case of Richard Hofmeier -- the creator of Cart Life (Hofmeier, 2011).",
   "[13] Tour Bueno project offers a good panorama of this diversity, at least in the European context. More information: www.tourbueno.com.",
